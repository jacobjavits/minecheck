[Data centers](https://computer.howstuffworks.com/data-centers1.htm) are centralized locations where computing equipment is concentrated for the purpose of collecting, storing, processing, distributing and accessing large amounts of data.  In order to help better understand how data centers work, we’ve put together a list of five core components of a data center:

## Environmental Controls

A standardized and predictable environment is the cornerstone of any quality data center.  It’s important to keep the building cool and maintain appropriate humidity levels [(according to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center#Environmental_control), the recommended temperature range is 61-75 degrees Fahrenheit and 40-55% humidity).

## Security

Security is the foundation of a reliable data center.  One important security feature is to limit access to authorized personnel only; both to the physical building as well as to the data itself.  It is also critical to secure the building where the data center is housed by having round the clock security systems and alarms. By implementing these precautions, data centers can protect the integrity of the information stored within their walls.

## Monitoring

Monitoring of systems is critical to maintaining the health of your data center.  [A proper software system](https://www.minecheck.com/about/) can track how much bandwidth is in use, as well as energy, storage and rack space.  With a quality software system, monitoring can increase uptime and reduce the amount of man hours spent receiving, configuring, deploying and managing your data center.

## Facility & Site

Building sites can be specifically constructed for the purpose of housing data center infrastructure or can be remodeled buildings located on an ideal site.  Whether newly constructed or adapted, the building must be able to accommodate the racks, computing hardware, and electrical configurations needed to power the data center.  The site also must be able to connect to a power source and should be in a location with a cooler climate to reduce overall cooling costs. 

## Power

The electrical infrastructure of a data center is very complex.  Electrical management of a data center must be able to distribute, switch, and bypass power.  Data centers also have great lengths of cables that must be properly installed so that each machine can be connected to a power source, networks, and other devices.  Hiring an experienced team of electrical professionals to set up and manage your data system will guarantee safety standards are being met and reduce downtime in your data center.
