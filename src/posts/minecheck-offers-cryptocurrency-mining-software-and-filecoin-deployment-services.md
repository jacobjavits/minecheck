**Concord, NH, March 23, 2021 —** Minecheck, a company offering proprietary software for the cryptocurrency mining industry, as well as Fielcoin deployment services, celebrates its launch today.

Minecheck’s software enables cryptocurrency mining operation teams to automatically deploy, configure, and monitor their cryptocurrency environment in real-time, reducing the personnel and operating expense of a facility by almost 68 percent. The software platform allows teams to take swift, appropriate action to ensure a fully functioning, optimized environment, resulting in increased efficiency and reduced costs. 

“Configuring, deploying and managing miners can be an incredibly time consuming process,” said Kyle Sidles, co-founder and CEO of Minecheck. “Our software was designed not only to automate this process, but to provide real-time, actionable data that enables teams to get the most from their mining infrastructure investment.” 

Minecheck’s software provides extensive features, including an intuitive system that allows miners to receive and scan in inventory; an automated process with configuration templates; deployment of miners to specific racks for repairs; collection of key stats and prediction of potential failures; and ongoing maintenance and remote break-fix solutions.

Additionally, Minecheck also offers deployment services for Filecoin — a peer-to-peer network supported by blockchain technology that allows users to buy and sell unused storage on an open market. The Filecoin network is designed to reward participants at multiple levels, inviting anyone to participate as a storage provider and monetize their open hard drive space. Minecheck works with clients to reduce the time spent on Filecoin deployment from months to weeks, simplify and scale the management of the entire Filecoin ecosystem, and optimize their Filecoin investment.

“We believe that Filecoin will play a significant role in the decentralized storage movement, particularly with the rise of Web 3.0,” said Sidles. “Minecheck is at the forefront of this movement, and we are thrilled to be able to offer clients the knowledge and expertise to help them plan, deploy and optimize their Filecoin investment.”
