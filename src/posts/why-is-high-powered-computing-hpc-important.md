title: Why is High Powered Computing (HPC) important?
description: "As technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial
  intelligence (AI), and 3-D imaging evolve, the size and amount of data that
  organizations have to work with is growing exponentially.  To manage these new
  technologies, businesses need fast, highly reliable infrastructure to process,
  store, and analyze massive amounts of data. This is why high performance
  computing (HPC) is important.  "

As technologies such as the [Internet of Things](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jacobmorgan/2014/05/13/simple-explanation-internet-things-that-anyone-can-understand/#7c8bff1b1d09) (IoT), [artificial intelligence](https://www.forbes.com/sites/nicholasfearn/2019/09/13/how-businesses-can-get-the-most-value-from-artificial-intelligence/#583cc91e3655) (AI), and [3-D imaging](https://www.forbes.com/sites/robinseatonjefferson/2019/01/31/expanding-3d-printing-network-aims-to-improve-us-veterans-health-care/#4c2e786b160d) evolve, the size and amount of data that organizations have to work with is growing exponentially.  To manage these new technologies, businesses need fast, highly reliable infrastructure to process, store, and analyze massive amounts of data. This is why high performance computing (HPC) is important.  

HPC are the computing resources that allow people to solve their problems faster or treat larger problems than they would be able to do using standard computing. 

## How do HPC systems work? 

HPC systems incorporate a range of technologies including computers, servers, and software. This creates a large network that works to complete multiple tasks at once.  

The components of an HPC system are no different than what you would find on your home laptop.  The difference is that instead of being just one device, there are clusters of computers working together at a great volume. 

## Why is HPC important for business?

With the vast amount of data available in todayâ€™s market, businesses must be able to collect and process information in real-time.  Certain companies have such a vast amount of data that they require HPC computing capabilities to process, analyze, and store that data.

In an increasingly data-driven world, companies are also feeling the pressure to accelerate their [digital transformation](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/unlocking-success-in-digital-transformations).  HPC bolsters efforts to automate processes and provide better solutions.
