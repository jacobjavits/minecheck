Minecheck, a company offering proprietary software for the cryptocurrency mining industry, as well as Fielcoin deployment services, announces today that its Co-Founder and CEO Kyle Sidles has been selected to participate in Filecoin’s MinerX Fellowship Program. He was one of 30 fellows chosen worldwide based on demonstrated expertise and contributions to improving the Filecoin network.   

 

Filecoin’s MinerX Fellowship Program, which launched this past January with its first class of fellows and is now in its third term, engages small and medium-sized miners distributed across the world to help improve Filecoin’s experience and productivity in the early stages of the network. It is designed to build a solid foundation of geographically-diverse, reliable, long-term storage options to accelerate the development of tools and services in the Filecoin ecosystem. Additionally, the MinerX program will identify areas to improve the experience of being a miner for the rest of the Filecoin community.

 

MinerX Fellows are selected based on their past contributions to improving the network, including: willingness to help and provide support for other miners and community members; participation and engagement in the Filecoin Slack and in other parts of the ecosystem; demonstrated attention to dealmaking/storage on Filecoin; and geographical and hardware setup diversity.

 

“I’m truly honored to be chosen as a Filecoin MinerX Fellow and thrilled by the opportunity it creates to enhance the Filecoin ecosystem,” said Sidles. “Filecoin is at the forefront of the decentralized storage movement, and we’ve already had tremendous interest from our clients in helping them plan, deploy and optimize their Filecoin investment.”  

 

Sidles co-founded Minecheck earlier this year, after nearly 10 years working in the cryptocurrency mining industry, during which he built and ran large scale data centers focused on blockchain processing. Previously, he was involved in computer technologies, including database design, programming, network infrastructure and application deployment, directing teams of developers in the United States, India and China to successfully build and launch over 200 various software projects.
